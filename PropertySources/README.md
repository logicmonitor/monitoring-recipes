## PropertySources

PropertySources are mainly used for the following two (2) purposes:
 1. Category/Tagging - Setting a system category for tagging and appliesTo purposes.
 2. Metadata - Gathering bits of additional information about a given host (serial number, model, firmware, etc). Heavily used when integrating with a CMDB/ITSM such as ServiceNow.
