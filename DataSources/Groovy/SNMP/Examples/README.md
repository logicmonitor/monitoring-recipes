## Examples
1. ActiveDiscovery_with_properties_with_enumeration - This script can be used as an Auto Discovery script for a multi-instance data source. It returns the list of instances with their name and any defined properties. This is an example only as the functionality covered here is already functional with other mechanisms already built.
