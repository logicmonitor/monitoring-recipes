## DataSource Merger
This script combines multiple xml files into one file. Incredibly useful when working with large numbers of DataSources, eliminating the need to individually import one by one.

#### How to use:
Terminal: 
  - Individual:`perl combine_ds datasource1.xml datasource2.xml`
  - Wildcard: `perl combine_ds datasource_*`
